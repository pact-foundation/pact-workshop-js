# Pact JS workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.
