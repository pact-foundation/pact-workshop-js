# Pact JS workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD
- [step 12: **broker webhooks**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step12#step-12---using-webhooks): Trigger provider workflows when contracts change, via webhooks
- [step 13: **pactflow broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step13#step-13---using-a-pactflow-broker): Implement a managed pactflow workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

[Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 1 - Simple Consumer calling Provider

We need to first create an HTTP client to make the calls to our provider service:

![Simple Consumer](diagrams/workshop_step1.svg)

The Consumer has implemented the product service client which has the following:

- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products
- `GET /products/{id}` - Retrieve a single product by ID

The diagram below highlights the interaction for retrieving a product with ID 10:

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/workshop_step1_class-sequence-diagram.svg)

You can see the client interface we created in `consumer/src/api.js`:

```javascript
export class API {

    constructor(url) {
        if (url === undefined || url === "") {
            url = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
        }
        if (url.endsWith("/")) {
            url = url.substr(0, url.length - 1)
        }
        this.url = url
    }

    withPath(path) {
        if (!path.startsWith("/")) {
            path = "/" + path
        }
        return `${this.url}${path}`
    }

    async getAllProducts() {
        return axios.get(this.withPath("/products"))
            .then(r => r.data);
    }

    async getProduct(id) {
        return axios.get(this.withPath("/products/" + id))
            .then(r => r.data);
    }
}
```

After forking or cloning the repository, we may want to install the dependencies `npm install`.
We can run the client with `npm start --prefix consumer` - it should fail with the error below, because the Provider is not running.

## Step 2 - Client Tested but integration fails

Now lets create a basic test for our API client. We're going to check 2 things:

1. That our client code hits the expected endpoint
1. That the response is marshalled into an object that is usable, with the correct ID

You can see the client interface test we created in `consumer/src/api.spec.js`:

```javascript
import API from "./api";
import nock from "nock";

describe("API", () => {

    test("get all products", async () => {
        const products = [
            {
                "id": "9",
                "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
                "name": "GEM Visa",
                "version": "v2"
            },
            {
                "id": "10",
                "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
                "name": "28 Degrees",
                "version": "v1"
            }
        ];
        nock(API.url)
            .get('/products')
            .reply(200,
                products,
                {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'});
        const respProducts = await API.getAllProducts();
        expect(respProducts).toEqual(products);
    });

    test("get product ID 50", async () => {
        const product = {
            "id": "50",
            "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
            "name": "28 Degrees",
            "version": "v1"
        };
        nock(API.url)
            .get('/products/50')
            .reply(200, product, {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'});
        const respProduct = await API.getProduct("50");
        expect(respProduct).toEqual(product);
    });
});
```



![Unit Test With Mocked Response](diagrams/workshop_step2_unit_test.svg)



Let's run this test and see it all pass:

```console
❯ npm test --prefix consumer

PASS src/api.spec.js
  API
    ✓ get all products (15ms)
    ✓ get product ID 50 (3ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.03s
Ran all test suites.
```

If you encounter failing tests after running `npm test --prefix consumer`, make sure that the current branch is `step2`.

Meanwhile, our provider team has started building out their API in parallel. Let's run our website against our provider (you'll need two terminals to do this):


```console
# Terminal 1
❯ npm start --prefix provider

Provider API listening on port 8080...
```

```console
# Terminal 2
> npm start --prefix consumer

Compiled successfully!

You can now view pact-workshop-js in the browser.

  Local:            http://127.0.0.1:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.20.17:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

You should now see a screen showing 3 different products. There is a `See more!` button which should display detailed product information.

Let's see what happens!

![Failed page](diagrams/workshop_step2_failed_page.png)

Doh! We are getting 404 everytime we try to view detailed product information. On closer inspection, the provider only knows about `/product/{id}` and `/products`.

We need to have a conversation about what the endpoint should be, but first...
